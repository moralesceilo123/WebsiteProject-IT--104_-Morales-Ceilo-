      <h2>HTML/CSS Portrait</h2>
      <img src="img/HTML CSS Portrait.png" alt="Project 1 Image 1">
      <p>In my latest project, I'm diving into the world of web design by creating a special portrait using HTML and CSS. Instead of using a paintbrush, I'm using lines of code to bring this portrait to life! It's like magic happening right on my screen
        a beautiful bird flying in the sky. I'm using code to draw the bird making sure it looks just right with all its colors and details.
        I'm adding words from songs and poems to the picture it is like giving the bird something to say.
        all the amazing things we can create using technology and imagination.
        Welcome to my world of creativity and fun, where we can make magic happen with just a few clicks.</p>

      <h2>BootStrap</h2>
      <img src="img/project 3.png" alt="Project 3 Image 3">
      <p>In my Bootstrap project, I create web pages that are like colorful squares. Inside these squares, I put things
         like the name of the website, the title, and who made it. It's kind of like putting labels on different parts of a 
         big puzzle. Then, there's another square, sort of like an inbox, where I can put forms or messages from users. Bootstrap 
         makes it easy to arrange these squares neatly and make them look good on phones, tablets, or computers. It's like playing with 
         building blocks to make something awesome on the internet.</p>

      <h2>HTML/BOOTSTRAP</h2>
      <img src="img/project 4.png" alt="Project 4 Image 4">
      <p>In my HTML/Bootstrap project, I use a combination of grid and flexbox systems to organize and layout content on web pages. 
        It's like arranging items on a grid or moving them around flexibly to create a visually appealing design. 
        With Bootstrap's grid system, I can divide the page into rows and columns, making it easy to place content exactly where I want it. 
        Flexbox, on the other hand, gives me more control over how elements behave and align within those grid sections, 
        allowing for dynamic and responsive layouts. Together, they make building websites efficient and enjoyable, like solving a
         puzzle where every piece fits perfectly into place.</p>

      <h2>Certification</h2>
      <img src="img/project 5.png" alt="Project 5 Image 5">
      <p>At freecodecamp.org, I work through certifications that feel like unlocking achievements in a video game. 
        Each certification represents a new level of mastery in coding skills, like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or responsive web design. 
        It's like going on a quest where I tackle challenges and earn badges along the way. Completing these certifications not only boosts my 
        confidence but also validates my expertise to potential employers. Plus, the supportive community and helpful
         resources make the journey even more rewarding. It's like leveling up my coding superpowers one certification at a time.</p>
